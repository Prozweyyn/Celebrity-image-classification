There are 4 ways we can follow to collect data:
	Manually download from chrome-manual and labour intensive. Applicable for small data but not for large data
	Use python and web scraping- falls in the grey area as most sites dont like their info getting scraped
	Fatkun chrome tool- most user friendly and free tool
	Buy data from 3rd party vendors
